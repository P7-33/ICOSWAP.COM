.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the
.B paracode
command.

the text into visually similar stream of glyphs, while using completely
different codepoints.
It is an excellent didactic tool demonstrating the principles and advanced
use of the Unicode standard.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-t tables
.BI \-\-tables tables

Use given list of conversion tables, separated by a plus sign.

Special name 'all' selects all the tables.

Note that selecting 'other', 'cyrillic_plus' and 'cherokee' tables (and 'all')
makes use of rather esoteric characters, and not all fonts contain them.

Special table 'mirror' uses quite different character substitution,
is not selected automatically with 'all' and does not work well
with anything except plain ascii alphabetical characters.

Example:

paracode \-t cyrillic+greek+cherokee

paracode \-t cherokee  <input >output

paracode \-r \-t mirror  <input >output



Possible tables are:

cyrillic

cyrillic_plus

greek

other

cherokee

all
.
.TP
.B \-r

Display text in reverse order after conversion,
best used together with \-t mirror.
