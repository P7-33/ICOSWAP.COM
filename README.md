Abstract

   The United States of America has adopted a suite of Secure Hash
   Algorithms (SHAs), including four beyond SHA-1, as part of a Federal
   Information Processing Standard (FIPS), specifically SHA-224 (RFC
   3874), SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The purpose of this document
   is to make source code performing these hash functions conveniently
   available to the Internet community.  The sample code supports input
   strings of arbitrary bit length.  SHA-1's sample code from RFC 3174
   has also been updated to handle input strings of arbitrary bit
   length.  Most of the text herein was adapted by the authors from FIPS
   180-2.

   Code to perform SHA-based HMACs, with arbitrary bit length text, is
   also included
